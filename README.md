# Holly

A React implementation of [Davide Pacilio's](https://gumroad.com/davidepacilio) free landing page template. His design and layout has been rebuilt with React using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The motivation in doing this was to for my own practice and implementation of what I am learning in React.

## Getting started

* First, ensure that node.js & npm are both installed. If not, choose your OS and installation method from [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and follow the instructions.
* Next, use your command line to enter your project directory.
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to run project.

## TODO

[ ] Smaller screens need improved responsive design since the refactor to Tailwind CSS.
